## todo

* simple (X) button to clear filter
* nicer style (blend in with status bar)
* update filter when directory is expanded

## warning

This is my first Atom plugin, hacked together in an evening.  
It probably won't break anything (e.g. delete all your code :)  
but still: use at your own risk!

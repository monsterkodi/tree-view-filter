and the usual suspects

* almost as good as coffee: [coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org/)

* grunt, grunt: [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)

## warning

This is my first Atom plugin, hacked together in an evening.  
It probably won't break anything (e.g. delete all your code :)  
but still: use at your own risk!
